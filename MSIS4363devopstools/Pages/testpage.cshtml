        <h2>Azure DevOps</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                One of the first tools explored in MSIS 4363 is Azure DevOps, which helps connect code repositories, build automation, and deployment pipelines into one streamlined process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students learn how to create and manage build and release pipelines for Azure web applications, applying real-world DevOps practices used in enterprise environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this framework, we gain a clear understanding of how development and operations work together—turning traditional software projects into collaborative, automated systems.

        <h2>Visual Studio</h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio serves as the foundation for our development environment. It’s where we write, debug, and test code before integrating with other DevOps tools.
            By connecting Visual Studio to Azure DevOps and GitHub, we experience firsthand how local development ties into larger, automated workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than focusing on advanced coding techniques, this course emphasizes how to think like a modern developer—designing, deploying, and maintaining applications through efficient processes.

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Version control is a cornerstone of teamwork and project reliability. Git provides that foundation, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In MSIS 4363, Git isn’t just about commands—it’s about learning discipline and structure in managing software changes across environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                These practices directly translate into the workplace, where version control and documentation are critical for both accountability and innovation.

        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub expands the role of version control by introducing collaboration through hosted repositories, pull requests, and issue tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students explore how GitHub integrates with Azure DevOps and Jenkins to create continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach provides an understanding of how software moves from a developer’s machine to a production environment with security, reliability, and scalability.

        <h2>Docker</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Docker introduces the concept of containerization—packaging applications with all their dependencies so they can run reliably in any environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course covers how to create and deploy Docker-based web applications in Azure, giving students firsthand experience with modern deployment practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding Docker’s role in scalability and consistency helps bridge the gap between development and operations, reinforcing key DevOps principles.

        <h2>From Classroom to Career: Building the DevOps Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            MSIS 4363 isn’t about writing the most complex applications—it’s about learning how to think like a professional developer in today’s evolving software landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker, Jenkins, and Jira, students learn the interconnected framework of software delivery and teamwork that defines modern IT operations.
        </p>
